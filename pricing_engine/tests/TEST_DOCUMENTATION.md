# Testing and Validation Suite Documentation

## Overview

This comprehensive testing suite ensures the reliability, compliance, and performance of the dynamic pricing model's compliance and safety systems.

## Test Components

### 1. Compliance Test Suite (`compliance_test_suite.py`)

Tests all state-specific compliance rules and regulations.

**Key Features:**
- Massachusetts tax and pricing rules validation
- Rhode Island margin and discount requirements
- Promotional pricing compliance
- Operating hours restrictions
- Edge case handling

**Test Categories:**
- Tax calculation accuracy
- Minimum/maximum price enforcement
- Promotional discount limits
- Medical product pricing caps
- Cross-border considerations

### 2. Safety Test Scenarios (`safety_test_scenarios.py`)

Validates safety control systems and protections.

**Key Features:**
- Price change limit enforcement
- Canary deployment testing
- Rollback mechanism validation
- MAPE threshold monitoring
- Stress testing capabilities

**Test Types:**
- Daily/hourly price change limits
- Inventory-based constraints
- Performance degradation detection
- Emergency rollback procedures

### 3. Performance Benchmarks (`performance_benchmarks.py`)

Measures system performance and scalability.

**Benchmark Categories:**
- Compliance validation throughput
- Safety check performance
- Batch processing efficiency
- Concurrent operation handling
- Cache effectiveness
- Rollback operation speed

**Stress Testing:**
- High-volume transaction handling
- Sustained load testing
- Resource utilization monitoring

### 4. Edge Case Validator (`edge_case_validator.py`)

Tests system behavior with unusual or extreme inputs.

**Edge Case Categories:**
- **Boundary Cases**: Zero prices, maximum values, exact thresholds
- **Null/Missing Values**: Handling of incomplete data
- **Extreme Values**: Very large numbers, high volumes
- **Concurrent Access**: Race conditions, simultaneous updates
- **Invalid States**: Improper state transitions

## Running Tests

### Full Test Suite
```python
from pricing_engine.tests import ComplianceTestSuite, SafetyTestScenarios

# Run all compliance tests
compliance_suite = ComplianceTestSuite(compliance_engine)
results = compliance_suite.run_all_tests()

# Run safety scenarios
safety_tests = SafetyTestScenarios(safety_controller, canary_tester, rollback_manager)
safety_results = safety_tests.run_all_scenarios()
```

### Performance Testing
```python
from pricing_engine.tests import PerformanceBenchmark

benchmark = PerformanceBenchmark(compliance_engine, safety_controller)
results = benchmark.run_all_benchmarks(iterations=1000)

# Stress test
stress_results = benchmark.stress_test(duration_seconds=300, target_qps=100)
```

### Edge Case Validation
```python
from pricing_engine.tests import EdgeCaseValidator

validator = EdgeCaseValidator(compliance_engine, safety_controller)
edge_results = validator.validate_all_edge_cases()
```

## Test Scenarios

### Compliance Scenarios

1. **MA Tax Compliance**
   - Excise tax calculation (10.75%)
   - State tax (6.25%)
   - Local tax variations

2. **RI Weight-Based Tax**
   - Per-gram tax calculation
   - Margin requirements (15% minimum)
   - Medical vs recreational distinctions

3. **Promotional Limits**
   - MA: 30% maximum discount
   - RI: 20% medical, 25% recreational
   - Bundle pricing rules

### Safety Scenarios

1. **Price Change Limits**
   - 10% daily maximum
   - 5% single change maximum
   - Hourly change velocity

2. **Canary Testing**
   - 10% of SKUs tested
   - 24-hour monitoring period
   - Automatic rollback triggers

3. **Emergency Procedures**
   - Compliance violation rollback
   - Performance degradation response
   - Manual intervention handling

## Success Criteria

### Compliance Tests
- 100% pass rate for critical compliance rules
- <1% false positive rate
- All tax calculations accurate to $0.01

### Safety Tests
- All price limits enforced correctly
- Canary tests detect issues with 95% accuracy
- Rollbacks complete within 60 seconds

### Performance Benchmarks
- Compliance validation: >1000 ops/second
- Batch processing: >10,000 products/minute
- Cache hit rate: >80%

### Edge Cases
- Zero critical failures
- All exceptions handled gracefully
- System remains stable after edge case testing

## Continuous Testing

The test suite should be run:
- **Hourly**: Quick compliance checks
- **Daily**: Full compliance and safety validation
- **Weekly**: Performance benchmarks
- **Monthly**: Complete edge case validation
- **Before Deployment**: All tests must pass

## Test Result Interpretation

### Compliance Results
- **Pass**: System complies with all regulations
- **Warning**: Non-critical issues found
- **Fail**: Critical compliance violations detected

### Safety Results
- **Green**: All safety systems operational
- **Yellow**: Minor issues, monitoring increased
- **Red**: Critical safety violation, immediate action required

### Performance Results
- Compare against baseline metrics
- Monitor for degradation trends
- Alert on >10% performance drop
